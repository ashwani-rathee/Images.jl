# ImagesCore.jl

ImagesCore is the lowest-level component of the system of packages
designed to support image processing and computer vision. Its main
role is to simplify "conversions" between different image
representations through different "view" types, and to provide some
useful low-level "traits" that simplify the writing of algorithms.
